# Governance

The Tremor project originated as an internal solution at Wayfair and has become a CNCF sandbox project with an open community-based open-source development model. There are three pillars to the governance model for tremor that are worth explicitly acknowledging:

## Governance Model

The Tremor project's high-level governance model is designed around the requirements and best practices of the CNCF/Linux Foundation Core Infrastructure Initiative best practices, targeting a silver badge status.

* [CNCF CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en)
* [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io)
* [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org)

## Project Model

The Tremor project/product management model is designed around the Linux kernel development practices and processes.

* [Linux Kernel Organization](https://www.kernel.org)

## Community Model

The Tremor project has adopted the Rust community model and practices for engaging with people and ensuring that all tremor contributors and stakeholders respect the code of conduct at all times.
